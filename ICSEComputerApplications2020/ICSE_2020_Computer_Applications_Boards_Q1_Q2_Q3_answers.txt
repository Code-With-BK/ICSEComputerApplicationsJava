Answers to all Questions of ICSE Computer Applications 2020 Boards Paper 

Q1

(a) intermediate code generated by the compiler after the compilation of source code(JAVA Program)

(b)
Object is an instance of a class  | Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are
                                    created.
Object allocates memory when it   | Class doesn't allocated memory when it is created.
is created

(c)
i) final
ii) System.exit(0)
 
(d)
i) primitive
ii) non-primitive
iii) primitive
iv) non-primitive

(e)
symbols used for performing specific operations in Java
Arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/), Relational operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)

Q2

(a) the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes
int m = 20;
Integer n = m; 

(b)
length - to find the size of an array
Ex: 
int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int len = arr.length;

length() - to find the length of the string
ex: 
String s = "Hello";
int len = s.length();

(c) refers to the use of more than one constructor in a class 
Ex: 
class Student {
	String name;
	int age;
	Student(String n) {
		name = n;
		age = 16;
	}
	Student(String n, int a) {
		name = n;
		age = a;
	}
} 


(d)
 import the built-in and user-defined packages, class or interface in Java

 import java.util.*;


(e)
A loop that runs infinitely and does not have a stopping condition
ex:
for( int i=-1; i<0; i-- ) {
	System.out.println(i);
}

Q3

(a)
Math.sqrt(b*b - (4*a*c))

(b)
28

(c)
Earth is Beautiful
false

(d)
A picture is worth    "A thousand words."

(e)
k = 26
// loop runs 3 times, for values of k=5,12,19


(f) 
i) boolean
ii) int

(g)
if( x>5 && x>y )
	System.out.println(x+y);

(h)
	switch(ch) {
		case 'c':
		case 'C':
			System.out.print("COMPUTER");
			break;
		case 'h':
		case 'H':
			System.out.print("HINDI");
			break;
		default:
			System.out.print("PHYSICAL EDUCATION");
	}

(i)
	i) 11.0
	ii) 12.0

(j)
	boolean r = (n1 > n2) ? true: false;
